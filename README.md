# Project1a_Netwok-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
I designed this network configuration for the network of office, given some constraints. This problem was presented in our project Final. The main role was to subnet the IP addresses correctly.

## CASE STUDY

In an office building there are 4 main floors. Distribution Network
On the Network and Internet This office is divided into various networks, there are 4 floors

  1st Floor : Customer Service Room, Administration room, Collaborative Area
              
  2nd Floor : Free space
  
  3rd Floor : Employee Room 1, Employee Room 2, Employee Room 3
              
  4th Floor : Admin Room, Server Room

## User and Device Coverage
User and Device Coverage
In this network, of course, the scope of users is employees.

The devices used include:

 - Computer / Personal Computer (PC)
 - Laptop
 - Printer
 - Servers
 - Smartphone
 - Tablet
 
 For network devices used include:

  - Switch that functions most primarily is as a liaison for a number of computer devices in order to be able to exchange packets and forward data to various destination  devices.

  - Router that has a function to connect networks from one to another.

## NOTE 
the .pkt file is in the main file
### How to run
Install Cisco Packet Tracer and then simply open the main file.pkt. The whole network is in working condition. You can check it by sending a packet from one system to another or through using the PING command in the Cisco Packet Tracer.

This solution works for version 6.2 or above of Cisco Packet Tracer.
